# To-Do List Web Application
#### Video Demo: <URL HERE>
#### Description:
The To-Do List Web Application is an interactive, user-friendly tool designed to help individuals efficiently manage their tasks and responsibilities. This project serves as a culmination of the skills and concepts I have learned throughout the CS50 course, particularly in web development, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to add, complete, delete, and filter tasks, providing a comprehensive solution for task management.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Users can easily input tasks into the list using a text input field and an "Add" button. Each task is saved with a unique identifier, which ensures that every task can be managed individually. The input field includes placeholder text that guides users on what to enter, enhancing user experience.

- **Complete Tasks**: The application allows users to mark tasks as completed by clicking a checkbox next to each task. Completed tasks are visually distinguished from pending tasks through strikethrough formatting, providing a clear overview of progress and allowing users to easily see what has been accomplished.

- **Delete Tasks**: Users have the option to delete individual tasks or clear all tasks at once. This feature is particularly useful for maintaining a clean and organized list, especially as the number of tasks grows. Users can delete completed tasks to declutter their view or remove any tasks that are no longer relevant.

- **Task Filtering**: The application offers filtering options to view all tasks, only pending tasks, or only completed tasks. This functionality allows users to focus on specific types of tasks, improving their productivity and making it easier to manage their workload. The filters are easily accessible through dropdown menus, making navigation seamless.

- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring that it functions well on a variety of devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones. This adaptability means that users can manage their tasks on the go, making the application a versatile tool for everyday life.

- **User Feedback**: The application provides visual feedback for user actions, such as adding a task or marking it as complete. This feedback is crucial for improving the user experience, as it assures users that their actions have been successfully executed.

## File Structure
- **index.html**: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the application. It includes the input section, task list, and buttons for task management. The HTML structure is organized to ensure readability and maintainability, making it easy to modify or expand upon in the future.

- **style.css**: This file contains all the styling for the application, providing an attractive and user-friendly interface. It incorporates responsive design elements and custom styles for buttons and task items, ensuring that the application is visually appealing and functional on all devices.

- **index.js**: The core JavaScript file that handles the functionality of the application. It contains the logic for adding tasks, marking them as completed, deleting tasks, and filtering the task list. This file manages user interactions and updates the task display dynamically. The code is modular and well-commented, making it easy to follow and understand.

## Design Choices
Throughout the development of this project, several design choices were made to enhance usability and functionality:
1. **User-Centric Design**: The layout and features of the application were designed with the user in mind. Clear labeling of buttons and input fields ensures that users can navigate the app effortlessly. I prioritized intuitive design to minimize the learning curve for new users.

2. **Visual Feedback**: Using visual cues, such as striking through completed tasks, helps users quickly identify their progress. This enhances the user experience by providing immediate feedback on their actions. The application also employs color coding for buttons, making it easier for users to recognize their functions at a glance.

3. **Modular Code Structure**: The decision to separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into distinct files promotes better organization and maintainability of the code. This structure also makes it easier to update or expand features in the future. Following best practices in code organization has made it possible for other developers to contribute to or modify the project.

4. **Accessibility Considerations**: While developing the application, I made a conscious effort to ensure that it is accessible to users with disabilities. This includes using semantic HTML and ensuring sufficient color contrast for readability. Future iterations may include additional accessibility features, such as keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

## Future Improvements
While the current implementation of the To-Do List Web Application is functional and meets the basic requirements for task management, there are several potential improvements that could enhance the user experience:

- **User Authentication**: Implementing user accounts would allow users to save their tasks securely and access them from different devices. This feature would greatly enhance the application's usability, especially for users who want to maintain a persistent task list across multiple platforms.

- **Due Dates and Reminders**: Adding functionality to set due dates for tasks and reminders could help users manage their time more effectively. Notifications for upcoming deadlines would encourage timely task completion.

- **Task Categories**: Introducing the ability to categorize tasks (e.g., work, personal, urgent) would help users organize their tasks more efficiently. This could be implemented through tags or folders, allowing for a more structured approach to task management.

- **Dark Mode**: Implementing a dark mode option would provide users with the ability to customize their viewing experience, catering to personal preferences and reducing eye strain in low-light environments.

Overall, this To-Do List Web Application demonstrates my ability to apply programming concepts in a real-world scenario and serves as a valuable tool for managing daily tasks. I am proud of the project and look forward to further enhancements in the future. The skills I have gained from this project will undoubtedly contribute to my continued growth as a developer.
